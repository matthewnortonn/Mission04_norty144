<!-- paragraph about what I hope to get out of IS413 -->
<p>
    This semester in IS413, I hope to learn how to develope full scale applications for enterprises.
    I hope to be able to fluently code in C# and have a solid understanding of the basics. I understand that I will not be
    the best C# programmer after only one semester but I hope to be on track to become great one day. I also hope to learn how to teach others the basics of C# as I can see it being an important skill in my future.
